My story so far...

After high school I started studing Idustrial Engeneering and after some years of this beautiful career I understood that my passion was coding. I changed to another college
and continued studying Computer Science. I am now a father of two daughters and a housband. Currently I am working as an IT in a health center(5 years). I will have completed my Computer Science degree by May 2022. Since my passion for coding continues growing I am looking for a new job oportunity for me to grow with.
